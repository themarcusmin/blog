Hello World and Happy Thingyan!<br />
Today marks the first day of the Burmese New Year and I am glad to have published
this blog. To be frank, it has been a real struggle to find motivation to create
this in the midst of 2021 Myanmar coup d'Ã©tat and Covid-19, and yet here we are.
The start of something new.
