My trip to Kalaw was super last-minute so I was packing like crazy in the morning of New Year's Day. The flight from Rangoon to Heho took only 45 minutes and I was there in Shan State in a flash.

Kalaw is a small hill town located 30-minute drive from Heho and 1-hour drive from Taunggyi. It is truly a paradise for those who love nature, coffee or chilly weather. Not to mention it is a go-to vacation spot for tourists and city folks alike.

Me and my friend, Tun, didn’t really have any plan beforehand for this trip so we decided to go full nomad. With two days at our disposal, we hit all the key locations suggested by google maps and local friends. It felt liberating to have the freedom to explore Kalaw without itinerary.

### Attractions

#### Kalaw Market

The Kalaw market offers a rich variety of organic local Shan products. You can find avocados, oranges, tea leaves, meat, poultry, greens, Khaw Pote (Shan snack), pickled vegetables and many more.

We were there every morning for Shan noodles, fried tofu, tofu nway and hin htote. I was savoring all the fantastic flavors with the hot herbal tea. Eating in the market was without a doubt, exceptional considering there are shoppers strolling around nearby and you can hear distant sounds of chatters all over the place. It’s a full-blown experience to eat like a local. _Don’t miss it._

<p class="tip">Tip: Always go for breakfast in the market.</p>

#### Railway Station

Kalaw Railway Station is a remarkable spot for photos and sightseeing. The station goes back to the colonial era and you will notice the resemblance of English architecture in the building structure. The old train compartments of yellow and crimson can be seen preserved on separate rails.

### Cafe

If you're a typical cafe person, you will feel right at home in Kalaw. Hop into a random cafe and you will find yourself sipping coffee, breathing the gentle wintry breeze and feeling the warmth of the coffee mug in no time.

#### Cafe Kalaw

Located 8-minute drive from the market, the two-storey cafe sits on the quiet hill and hides well behind the thick garden wall. Once inside the cafe, you will feel a sense of heart-warming comfort from the plants. I really enjoyed every moment of this tiny cafe from the creaky wooden floors to the fine aroma of the freshly brewed local coffee.

#### Random Coffee Truck

En route to Kalaw, we spotted a random coffee truck on the side of the road and decided for a stopover. Even though the place smelled of smog fumes from passing-by vehicles, the windy atmosphere was enough to overwhelm it. The stop was worth every moment as it was a perfect excuse to sightsee the country landscape of green hills. The experience was subliminal.

#### Hiking / Trekking

If you're into hiking/trekking, there is a 3-day trek from Kalaw to Inle Lake. In my opinion, it is something you do not want to miss out on in Kalaw. You will get to indulge in the local sceneries of green vegetation, remote villages and even exotic white brick stupa. That's what our local friends said.

Sadly, we were not trekking because of the time constraint. I assured myself I would be back for trekking next time.

#### Mine Lone Hill

Still we made it to the bottom of Mine Lone hill monastery. We were expecting a hiking trail to the top of the hill but it was a continuous climb of 45-degree steep staircases. Although the stairs were somewhat torn, eroded and lacking maintenance, the climb was manageable. It was supposed to be a 30-minute climb and we were overconfident we would make it shortly. 20 minutes into it, we failed miserably. Tun started puking and falling asleep. I had a sudden shortness of breath and retired myself over a wooden bench. Besides, junta troops were camping in the hilltop monastery. _Typical._

Lessons were learned the hard way. Never race hike after lunch.

Even so the view was phenomenal. I could observe a skyline of hillside housings with some trees clouding the landscape. Imagine the sightseeing at the top of the hill. I am definitely coming back to complete the climb.

### Nightlife

As a remote hill town, locals are early birds by nature. They would go to sleep as soon as 9 PM so you won't be finding a lot of places for the nightlife. The imposed nationwide curfew made it worse and most eateries closed by 8 PM.

#### Hi Bar

We hopped into Hi Bar around 6 PM. It is a tiny bustling bar, yet you can feel the coziness from the warm ambience of the candle-lit atmosphere, and the antique collections of coins and vintage cash notes hanging around the bar top. You will also find fellow travellers escaping the mundane city life over drinks.

The bar does not serve food so I had takeouts of BBQ skewers from the street grills next door. I washed them down with a couple of whiskey sour and boy, the combo was just incredible. The bar had pre-2000s Burmese music running in the background and it was nostalgia-inducing. If you ask me about one memorable thing from this bar, it would be the toast from the bar owner, U Myo, “Here’s to drinking till 90!” _Catchy._ The moment was short-lived as the place closed at 8 PM sharp.

### Recap

With all that being said, Kalaw is a lot more than a 2-day trip and I still wish I were in this beautiful town for a week at least. If you’re adventurous, 3-day trekking from Kalaw to Inle Lake will suit you well. If you’re a coffee whore, there are cafes sprawling in every corner of Kalaw. If you’re a foodie, every food place offers their own unique version of authentic Shan cuisine. If you like drinking, you will feel a hearty small town vibe in Hi Bar.
